Workflow files:

    - single_xrb_file.py            Perform a single XRbinary simulation (mainly for testing)
    - Parameterstudy.ipynb          Visualize the impact of different parameters on the model
                                    predictions (use this abundantly in the beginning to GDTable
                                    a good feeling for light curves, and for playing around with
                                    parameters/parameterisations)

    - xrb_root_f.py                 Perform XRbinary simulations on a parameter grid

    - Model_Construction.py         Construct the astromodels model from the XRbinary grid 
                                    points (used in fitting process down the line)
    - exec.sh                       Shortcut for multiple model constructions in parallel
                                    (hint: there are two models per band, so doing each band in
                                    parallel is moste efficient)
    - Priortest.ipynb               Testing the model's ability to even cover the data, drawing from
                                    the priors' ranges. Do not underestimate this step's importance
    - Fit_componentwise.ipynb       Files for the fitting process, either interactively
    - Fit_componentwise.py          or in the background (usually faster)

    - Process_Results.ipynb         Create PPCs for the model and BH mass, donor mass posteriors etc.

    - astropy_workshop.ipynb        A notebook for testing around with astropy features, such as 
                                    synthetic stellar spectra and what brightness they would produce
                                    in the GROND filters
    - Distance_disentangler.ipynb   A testground notebook for all things distance towards a system
                                    based on information from the system (stellar spectral type, absolut
                                    magnitude, extinction etc)
